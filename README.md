a small simple tool that displays all Characters Magic/Weapon Level and Experience in Real Time via Memory Reading.

i made this tool to be able to see how much experience i can get per skill and optimize my leveling.


Instructions:

1. Open Grandia 1 or 2 HD Remake and load a save.
2. Start a battle to let the Game load needed Data.
3. Open the tool and click "Start Reading".

Notes:

1. On some machines the tool need admin privileges.

2. If you get the Error Message: 'Unable to read Data! Make sure you were in a Battle atleast once!' you need to initialize a battle first.

3. This tool only reads memory, no edits/writes are possible.
