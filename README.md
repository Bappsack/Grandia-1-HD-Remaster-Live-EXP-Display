a small simple tool that displays all Characters Magic/Weapon Level and Experience in Real Time.

i made this tool to be able to see how much experience i can get per skill and optimize my leveling.


Instructions:

1. Open Grandia 1 HD Remake and load a save.
2. Start a battle to update to let the Game load needed Data we need.
3. Start the tool and click: "Start Reading".

Notes:

On some machines the tool need admin privileges.

If you get the Error Message: 'Unable to read Data! Make sure you were in a Battle atleast once!' you need to initialize a battle first.
